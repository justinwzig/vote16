			<p>We envision a future in which voting is second nature and where <strong>students and youth</strong> are excited <br>
				about politics -- they <strong>participate</strong> in political organizations in school and outside it, <br>
				<strong>advocate</strong> for their rights and their futures, and are able to <strong>exercise</strong> the most basic <br>
			right of a democracy: voting.</p>

				<h2>FAQ & Research</h2>
				<p>We get asked some questions pretty frequently -- here's some in-depth answers.</p>
			</header>
			<section>
				<p><strong>How can lowering the voting age make a difference?</strong></p>
				<p>Research shows that voting is habitual. By lowering the voting age to 16, we increase the possibility that a person will vote in the next election by 25 percent. The earlier people start voting, the more likely they are to become lifelong voters.</p>
				<p><strong>Why are people any more likely to start voting at 16 than 18?</strong></p>
				<p>Because 16 falls within a better developmental stage to start building voting habits. Age 18 is tough: many 18-year-olds are in the midst of major life transitions that make it a difficult time to take on the daunting prospect of registration, especially if they are moving out of their home state, and deciding how to vote. At 16, however, students are searching for ways to broaden their influence on the world, and are still a part of the communities in which they grew up, something that has been demonstrated to change both how people think about politics and the likeliness that they go to the polls.</p>
				<p><strong>Will 16- and 17-year-olds vote when given the chance?</strong></p>
				<p>Increasingly, youth are getting involved in political organizations across the country in their high schools and communities, indicating a broader interest in political engagement. This extends beyond just those youth who are directly involved in political clubs, as these organizations frequently involve initiatives to register voters and encourage others outside the club to participate in civic life.</p>
				<p>Since the local voting age was lowered in Takoma Park, Maryland in 2013, 16- and 17-year-olds are turning out to vote at a rate about four times greater than the overall turnout.</p>
				<p><strong>Are 16- and 17-year-olds mature enough to vote?</strong></p>
				<p>18-year-olds don’t have a sudden increase in political understanding. In fact, the most dramatic change in reasoning ability happens around puberty. At 16 and 17, we are ready and able to make thoughtful political decisions.</p>
